# Works with Windsurf
https://windsurf.run/mcp

* Flet + Pygpt + Auth ( Linux APP ) 
* MCP Store integration A way for the app to pull from an mcp store that is an open github repo.( Great Idea ) 
* https://pygpt.net/
* https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/
* Can use poetry to help do initial build.
* Vscode Plugin MCP Store via pyinstaller.
* Mobile: Pyinstaller doesnt work? Briefcase not a solution, x10 apks not practical. ( Maybe Chaquopy ? ) 

* Librechat Version as well. 

* Android APP Idea + Openrouter + Smithery chat app. Supports AI + MCP. Run from the phone. 

# I dont like that it requires smithery as a middleman. Maybe just make my own or use docker , not sure yet. 

* Librechat and smithery.ai
* Enable RAG too.

https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/azure

* Can Make a custom one
* Can use existing one. Azure seems interesting. Wonder if I can use it for cloud compliance?
*https://hub.docker.com/mcp/server/duckduckgo/overview

* Can also build MCP server using python.
* Also make an agent with https://www.langchain.com/

# Librechat not listed
* Vscode and cloud compliance
* https://smithery.ai/server/@tharuneshwar-s/auditron-soc-mcp-server
* Maybe create an MCP server for cloud custodian. 
* CIS Compliance .
* https://github.com/Eazy-Ops/cloud-custodian-mcp


===========

* Librechat and terraform.
* https://server.smithery.ai/@hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/mcp
* AWS - https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/aws-terraform
* AWS has many of them. Need to test with Librechat. 


==========

# Not sure flutter is capable. This does complicate security and deployment if just a mobile app. Maybe need some auth login and stripe or privacy focused version?

* Flet app Librechat type / opensearch / MCP Server / Lanchain agent. 

* Not sure. Maybe more secure to just use librechat and opensearch .


=======

Librechat + Nextcloud ( FreedomBox ) + Qdrant Vector DB ( https://qdrant.tech/ ) + MCP Server . 


======

* RAG Chat - LibreChat + Nextcloud + Qdrant    + MCP server (  FastAPI + Web search / Web Crawler + Celery/APScheduler + Secure way to store credentials + Caldev for scheduling and basics. )

* FastAPI (MCP) + APScheduler scheduling) + CALdev (job store + metadata) + Qdrant 



- Keep LibreChat as the UI; run an MCP backend to handle ingestion, embedding, ACLs, queries, and LLM calls.
- Bulk ingest flow: upload/download → extract text → chunk → embed → upsert to Qdrant (store chunk metadata and owner).
- Also ingest web results (crawl/search API) and API data by extracting text/JSON, chunking, embedding, and upserting.
- Use workers + scheduler (Celery/APScheduler) for bulk/recurring jobs; store job state in Postgres or sqlite3/TL;DR:

- Deduplicate with chunk hashes; filter queries by owner/permissions in MCP.
- LibreChat triggers chat/query to MCP; MCP queries Qdrant, builds prompt, calls LLM, returns answers with citations.

Want a ready FastAPI ingest script or MCP skeleton next?.
