**Found it.** Adminotaur agent is loading `.json` files, not `.yaml`:

```@/home/adminotaur/Documents/git/agent-store/adminotaur/adminotaur.py:103
        config_file = self.configs_dir / "slash-commands.json"
```

```@/home/adminotaur/Documents/git/agent-store/adminotaur/adminotaur.py:110
        config_file = self.configs_dir / "ai-config.json"
```

Also lines 121-123 reference `.json` registries.
